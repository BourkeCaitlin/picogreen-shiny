# picogreen-shiny

Tool for calculating DNA concentration using the picogreen assay measuring fluorescence

Currently works well with correctly formatted files (ie if I am using it), however as a tool that others might want to use, this repository is still work in progress...

- write documentation for input requirements and layouts
- separate pooling methods, the current normalisation plot was written for a specific pooling method that might not be always applicable
